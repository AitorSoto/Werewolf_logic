## How To Play

Werewolf is a super fun party game that can be played with a large group of people. If you are a villager, you have to identify and kill the werewolves by votation amongst the rest to win. If you are a werewolf, you must kill everyone else but another werewolves to win. After this little summary, we move on to the detailed rules.
